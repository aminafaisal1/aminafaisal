## About Me 
I'm passionate about learning new technologies, and creating projects that make a difference. I love designing and optimizing databases, and I'm always eager to dive into SQL projects. Whether I'm building a new database system from scratch or refining an existing one, I thrive on the challenge of writing efficient queries and ensuring data integrity. My enthusiasm for SQL and database management drives me to explore innovative solutions that can handle large data sets and streamline data operations. I also enjoy exploring data analysis, and other tech-related fields. Whether it's through personal projects or collaboration, I'm always looking to improve my skills and take on new challenges.

## Experience
## UC Berkeley Police Department Fall 2024
- Transformed SafeWalk’s data management system by shifting from Excel to a more robust MySQL database, streamlining
walk tracking, security check records and resource allocation.
- Created a comprehensive <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/#G1EyMGKbS_j85kPyIBEMT0kpZLHxT3anEP#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%22R2lEEEUBdFMjLlhIrx00%22%7D">Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram</a> to effectively model the database structure, streamline entity relationships, and improve data integrity.
- Developed and optimized MySQL queries to automate reporting processes, reducing manual analysis time by 40% and
providing timely insights for decision making.
- Created dynamic dashboards, visualising SafeWalk’s key metrics and enabling data driven decision making.

## Ecom Atlantic, Inc Summer & Fall 2023
- Developed Python scripts to automate data analysis, processing large datasets to assess quantity of shipments, effectively
reducing data discrepancies by 25%.
- Streamlining a reporting tool for the analysis of forward contract costings versus actual incurred costs enabling better
forecasting.
- Initiating a database with query functionality for vendor freight rates, improving accuracy of cost estimates for
international shipping by 15%.
- Conducting weekly Inventory Reconciliation summarizing discrepancies for management review, providing insights
reducing variances and let to improved inventory tracking

## Her Fight is Our Fight Summer 2022
- <a href="https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/066PowQPZgMy6ruSTCX-xWCtg#Screen_Shot_2025-02-04_at_2.33.06_PM">Designed</a> a data-driven pH indicator for early cervical cancer detection, increasing detection accuracy by 45% through
rigorous data analysis and iterative testing.
- Led research identifying brown, alkaline vaginal fluid as a key cervical cancer symptom, driving product innovation for
early detection.
- Spearheaded the design of a sanitary pad embedded with a pH indicator, detecting values >7 to check for implications of
disease
- Conducted extensive data gathering and field testing, optimising product efficacy by up to 50%.

## Spam-Ham Email Classifier

- Led a machine learning project focused on building a binary classifier using the SpamAssassin dataset, a benchmark dataset for identifying spam (unsolicited) vs. ham (legitimate) emails.  
- Applied supervised learning techniques to detect malicious content and reduce cybersecurity risks associated with email communications.
- Designed and fine-tuned a classification pipeline including preprocessing, feature extraction (e.g., term frequency-inverse document frequency), and vectorization for natural language data.
- Evaluated multiple ML models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM) to balance precision and recall, selecting the model that minimized both false positives and false negatives.
- Optimized the classifier's threshold and hyperparameters to reduce the risk of misclassifying legitimate emails (ham) as spam and vice versa, emphasizing real-world implications for data protection and privacy.
- Led team coordination through regular check-ins, assigning tasks, conducting error analysis, and presenting final findings with clear, visual performance metrics (ROC curves, confusion matrices).
- Gained hands-on experience in risk management and cybersecurity, learning how poorly tuned models could lead to data breaches, phishing attacks, or financial damage in a real-world email system.

## Housing Market Price Prediction Project
Link to project: <a href="https://github.com/aminafaisal1/IEORPROJECT165/blob/main/project165%20(12).ipynb">Here</a>

This project focuses on building predictive models to estimate housing prices using real-world residential property data. The dataset includes both quantitative and qualitative features such as area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, number of stories, parking spaces, proximity to main roads, and furnishing status. The primary objective was to explore, model, and interpret the key drivers of housing prices using various regression and machine learning techniques.


- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
  - Converted binary categorical variables (e.g., `yes`/`no`) to numerical format (1/0)  
  - Filled missing numerical values with 0 and categorical values with mode  
  - Removed outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to improve model stability

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
  - Analyzed distributions, correlations, and trends in features such as area, number of rooms, and stories  
  - Visualized relationships between features and target variable (price) using scatter plots, box plots, and pairplots  
  - Generated second-degree polynomial features to capture non-linear interactions among variables

- Model Development:  
  - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression: Built a baseline linear model and evaluated using MSE, RMSE, and R²  
  - Ridge Regression: Implemented L2 regularization with cross-validation to prevent overfitting and optimize alpha  
  - LASSO Regression: Applied L1 regularization to induce sparsity, removing non-essential features  
  - Nadaraya-Watson Estimator: Built a non-parametric kernel regression model to capture complex, nonlinear patterns in the data

- Model Evaluation and Optimization:  
  - Performed 5-fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness and reduce variance  
  - Conducted residual analysis to assess model fit and detect patterns in prediction errors  
  - Compared models based on RMSE, MSE, and R² on both training and test sets
